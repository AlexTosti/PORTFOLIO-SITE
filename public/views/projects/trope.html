      Trope offers a dynamic, non-passive viewing experience for users.

      This web experience was built with the goal of giving both
      producer and audience more control in their ability to
      leverage the Internet to share their knowledge.

      We began this process through a serious of brainstorms, our goal being to define the constraints and affordances
      that current web technologies provide. -->

    __We put emphasis on trying to come up with an interaction that ultimately
    changed one of the core mechanisms of a well known interaction. In this case, online video, Alex and myself
    looked at our list of technical affordances and asked the question;__
